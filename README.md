## ðŸŒŸ Task Overview: Creating a New Unity Engine 6 Project

This project was created as part of an initial setup task to establish a clean and manageable project structure in Unity Engine 6. The goal is to set up a solid foundation for future development by defining clear organization rules for all assets and components.

### 2. Project Structure Explanation

A well-defined folder structure is essential for scalability, collaboration, and maintainability. The following hierarchy was created under the root `Assets/` folder to ensure all project resources are logically segregated:

* **`Assets/Scripts`**: Centralized location for all C# source code files.
* **`Assets/Prefabs`**: Stores all reusable, configured GameObjects (e.g., player, enemies, modular environment pieces).
* **`Assets/Materials`**: Contains all materials used to define the visual appearance of meshes and objects.
* **`Assets/Textures`**: Holds all imported images used by materials and UI elements.
* **`Assets/Audio`**: Dedicated space for all sound effects and music tracks.
* **`Assets/Animations`**: Stores all animation clips, animation controllers, and Avatar files.
* **`Assets/Scenes`**: Contains all different levels, main menus, and environments within the game (currently holding `MainScene.unity`).

This structure ensures that any collaborator can immediately locate any type of asset needed for development.
